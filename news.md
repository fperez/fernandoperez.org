March 2013

:   I was awarded the 2012 [Award for the Advancement of Free
    Software](http://www.fsf.org/news/2012-free-software-award-winners-announced-2)
    for the creation of IPython and my contributions to the Open Source
    Scientific Python ecosystem. UC Berkeley also put out a [more
    detailed
    release](http://vcresearch.berkeley.edu/news/wresting-new-tricks-python-fernando-perez-wins-2012-award-advancement-free-software).

March 2011

:   I've finally gathered the [slides for our minisymposium on Python
    for Scientific computing](events/2011_siam_cse) at the SIAM CSE 2011
    conference ([blog
    post](http://blog.fperez.org/2011/04/python-goes-to-reno-siam-cse-2011.html)
    and

March 2011

:   The [Sage Days 29](http://wiki.sagemath.org/days29) workshop was a
    success on multiple fronts, and in particular for IPython we made a
    [ton of
    progress](http://blog.fperez.org/2011/03/ipython-and-scientific-python-go-to.html).


February 2011

:   During the [2011 AAAS annual
    meeting](http://www.aaas.org/meetings/2011/) I spoke at a symposium
    titled [The Digitization of Science: Reproducibility and
    Interdisciplinary Knowledge
    Transfer](http://www.stanford.edu/~vcs/AAAS2011/) organized by
    Columbia's [Victoria Stodden](http://stodden.net). I have put up a
    short [blog
    post](http://blog.fperez.org/2011/02/reproducible-research-at-aaas-2011.html)
    about the event as well as [my
    slides](http://fperez.org/talks/1102_aaas_reproducibility_fperez_slides.pdf)
    and an [extended
    abstract](http://fperez.org/talks/1102_aaas_reproducibility_fperez_extabs.pdf).


February 2011

:   I'm thrilled to have been invited to present the keynote at this
    year's
    [EuroScipy](http://www.euroscipy.org/conference/euroscipy2011)
    conference. I haven't had a chance yet to attend the European
    version of the SciPy conferences, so I'm very much looking forward
    to it.


December 2010

:   My recent trip to [Scipy India 2010](http://scipy.in/scipyin/2010)
    was a very interesting experience; I'm really impressed by the
    Indian government's vision with their [FOSSEE.in](http://fossee.in)
    project. Here are the [slides](talks/1012_scipy_india.pdf) for my
    invited talk and some general
    [pictures](https://picasaweb.google.com/fdo.perez/IndiaMumbaiAndHyderabad),
    but I have yet to write a proper post summarizing things. Stay
    tuned.


July 2010

:   Our paper [Double dissociation of two cognitive control networks in
    patients with focal brain
    lesions](http://www.pnas.org/content/107/26/12017.short) is out in
    [PNAS](http://www.pnas.org) ([PDF](papers/doubledis10_net_pnas.pdf)
    version).


January 2010

:   I'm very excited to visit Colombia for a month, to teach an
    intensive course on scientific computing using Python and a
    practical, modern and hopefully useful approach. I've created a
    section on [Teaching](teaching) with these materials, including a
    detailed page on the [planned course](#scicomp_course).

December 2009

:   `Some notes <indefero_dreamhost>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} on
    how to configure [InDefero](http://www.indefero.net) on a shared
    hosting account to host your own Git repositories for private
    collaboration (e.g. co-authoring of grants and papers using Git,
    something you may not want to do on a public site).

November 2009, how this site is built

:   I've added a `section <this_site>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
    with the tools used to build this site, which several people have
    inquired about.

November 2009, a discussion with Guido van Rossum

:   At our informal Berkeley [Py4Science
    seminar](http://profjsb.github.com/python-seminar), the November 4
    session was a very interesting discussion with Guido van Rossum, the
    creator of the Python language.

September 2009, PyDy

:   At our meeting series, Luke Peterson from UC Davis gave a very
    interesting talk on [PyDy](http://code.google.com/p/pydy), a project
    under the [SymPy](http://code.google.com/p/sympy) umbrella to
    symbolically describe mechanical systems and derive their equations
    of motion. ([video
    link](http://www.archive.org/details/ucb_py4science_2009_09_30_Luke_Peterson)).

September 2009, decorators

:   Some [notes about decorators for controlling
    execution](decorators.html) from a September 2009 talk at the
    Berkeley Py4Science group.
