A brief summary of where I come from... I was born in Medellín, Colombia[^1], where I did my undergraduate studies in [Physics](http://fisica.udea.edu.co) at the Universidad de Antioquia. From there I moved to Boulder, Colorado, where I completed my PhD in [particle physics](#instantons), before spending a few years as a [post-doc](#fast-algorithms) in Applied Mathematics. In 2008 I moved to the San Francisco Bay Area, where I now work at UC Berkeley, on research involving algorithms and tool development in neuroimaging.

I am a scientist and a geek, and thus I spend much of my time in front of either the computer or a book. If not there, you may find me climbing (hopefully outdoors!) and probably with a camera.

I also have a [blog](https://fdoperez.blogspot.com), where I mostly post items of interest related to IPython, SciPy and scientific computing in Python. I haven't been able to really get caught up in the whole blogging thing, so it's rather sparse. But people tell me it's useful so I may try to post more, we'll see...

[^1]: Yes, it's spelled like that, with two 'o's. Columbia with a 'u' is a [university](https://columbia.edu) in New York City. It's not that hard: ColOmbia is a cOuntry, ColUmbia is a University.
