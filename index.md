:::{warning} Rebuilding with [MyST](https://mystmd) - technology from the future! 

I am slowly rebuilding my website, as I lost my previous `fperez.org` domain. I will port some content, while the rest is available at the old site through [fperez.github.io/fperez.org](https://fperez.github.io/fperez.org).

# Welcome

I am an associate professor in the [Department of Statistics](http://statistics.berkeley.edu) at UC Berkeley, and a Faculty Scientist at the [Data Science and Technology Division](https://crd.lbl.gov/departments/data-science-and-technology) of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. I am the faculty director for the Berkeley Institute for Data Science ([BIDS](http://bids.berkeley.edu)), and co-director for the Eric and Wendy Schmidt Center for Data Science & Environment ([DSE](https://dse.berkeley.edu/)). I co-founded, and continue to advise, the [International Interactive Computing Collaboration - 2i2c](https://2i2c.org).

My research interests were shaped by years of working on a number of applied problems in physics, mathematics, neuroscience and earth science. Today, I focus on building open, reproducible science, and scientific uses of AI for problems in earth and the environment, as well as healthcare.

I am convinced that we need better tools for scientific computing, and that our efforts to build them based on the [Python](http://www.python.org) language can make a significant difference to how research is conducted and disseminated. I created the [IPython](http://ipython.org) project while a graduate student in 2001, which has now evolved into the large and collaborative [Project Jupyter](), where a talented team does all the hard work. I am an active member of the community that creates freely available scientific computing tools around the [Scientific Python stack](http://scientific-python.org).

The picture at the top is Colorado's incredible Continental Divide, specifically the Indian Peaks range, shot from [Brainard Lake](http://maps.google.com/maps/place?cid=1317471477502605538&q=brainard+lake,+colorado&hl=en) during a [beautiful fall day in 2004](https://photos.app.goo.gl/a3T1FoFUuaskh41JA). On the descent from that hike I spotted a great-looking [little couloir](https://photos.app.goo.gl/NQQKFGVR3QklzPZ52) that provided for a very nice [alpine day](https://photos.app.goo.gl/NQQKFGVR3QklzPZ52) one week later. Having that terrain 45 minutes from home is one thing (among many) that makes the Colorado Front Range the most amazing place to live I've known.
