I sometimes teach both short workshops and longer courses on scientific computing built around Python-based tools. This page is a central resource for teaching materials, though obviously the [](#Py4Science) pages are also relevant for this topic.

Course: Modern Scientific Computing

:   An month-long, intensive (6 hours a week) course on the modern
    practice of scientific computing, using mostly Python-based tools
    and aimed at the late-undergraduate or graduate level in the
    physical sciences, mathematics and engineering.

February 2010: Universidad de Antioquia, Medellín, Colombia

:   For the whole month, I\'ll be teaching the course linked above at
    the Physics department (where I did my undergraduate studies).
    [Specifics with local logistics (in Spanish)...](#udea_2010).

February 2010: Universidad de los Andes, Bogotá, Colombia

:   I will present a general lecture on scientific computing and will
    teach a one-day workshop at Uniandes, in Bogotá.
